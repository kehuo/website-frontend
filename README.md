# Website

This is the project for [my website](http://kevinhuo.cool). It's powered by [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
It supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which make it possible to seamlessly write JSX in the Markdown documents.
Moreover, it communicates with my self-hosted [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) server to get the rendered static [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and plan to use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service to provide interactive notebooks with the same content. You can find my Binder Repo [here](https://github.com/kehuo/website-binder).
